FreeDVDBoot ESR Patcher Gui v0.4 by Jabu

What's this?
This is a GUI fot the modded esrpatch.exe by edo9300.
It can patch PS2 ISOs with ESR and FreeDVDBoot
so they can be played on a unmodded PS2.
The hybrid 3.10/3.11 payload is included.

How to use this:
-Unpack the archive
-Run FDVDB_ESR_Patcher.exe
-Select your ISOs via the OpenFileDialog or just drag and drop your ISOs
-Select the payload(only one is included for now, it should be compatible with all Slim models)
-Press "Path!"
-If you got a "can't acces file" error, restart FDVDB_ESR_Patcher.exe with admin privilages
-That's all
